Let's start with base 10.  We are already familiar with writing numbers like
    341 = 1*10**0 + 4*10**1 + 3*10**2.
{Keep inmind that * means multiplication and ** means exponentiation.}
In general we can write any number as:
    Sum from -infinity to +infinity x_i * 10**i
where x_i is a digit ranging from 0 to 9 and only a finite number of them are not zero.

There is nothing special about 10 which is more appropiately referred to by its prime factorization, 2*5, in this context.  When we change bases, we change what 10 means.  The number 10 is value where we run out of digits and have to "carry" over to the next place to continue counting.  Using 2*5 as 10 might be somewhat restictive to a baker who might like to divide 10 things easily into groups of 3, 4, or 6.  So she might prefer 2**2 * 3 (prime factorization) as 10, ie, a dozen.  So the simple counting would look like:
    0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  A  B  10
where A is 9+1 and B is A+1.  If we use 10 = 2*5, it can only be evenly divided by 2 and 5.  But 10 = 4*3 = 2**2 * 3 can be evely divided by 2, 4, or 6.

So our general formula for some base, Z, is a little more complicated to express but essentially the same:
    Sum from -infinity to +infinity x_i * Z**i
but now we have Z symbols, 0 <= x_i < Z for the digits in base Z and Z is some number that we might express in the usual 10=2*5 base for convenience.

Computers are all about bits which we can sort of think of as switches that are on or off, so let's say off is 0 and on is 1.  Then we can represent numbers by an array of bits and the most natural base to use is base 2, or binary.  So if we have an array of 4 bits:
    [b1, b2, b3, b4]
Then we can express these numbers:
    [0,0,0,0]   0    0
    [0,0,0,1]   1    1
    [0,0,1,0]   2    2
    [0,0,1,1]   3    3
    [0,1,0,0]   4    4
    [0,1,0,1]   5    5
    [0,1,1,0]   6    6
    [0,1,1,1]   7    7
    [1,0,0,0]   8    8
    [1,0,0,1]   9    9
    [1,0,1,0]  10    A 
    [1,0,1,1]  11    B 
    [1,1,0,0]  12    C 
    [1,1,0,1]  13    D 
    [1,1,1,0]  14    E
    [1,1,1,1]  15    F
