I'm a new GitHub user and would like to setup a repository for a project that I have in mind.  My project is to establish a laboratory environment for experimenting with concepts and methods for implementing integrated web application platforms.  I'm a student in this area and have not formed a sufficient understanding of everything that will be involved in this endeavor so I need your assistance with setting up and configuring a new GitHub repository for keeping scripts, configuration files, documents, etc..  In addition to suggestions for setting up a GitHub repository, any comments about additional steps to establishing an evironment for working towards this objective would be appreciated. Here are some parameters that I think should apply to my project:

* There are multiple people participating in this project.
* We plan to follow, very loosely, an agile development process centered on a simple scrum board.
* We plan to make extensive use of AI chats for guidance in implenting the components of our web application platform experiments and need a wiki that will incorporate the chat suggestions along with our own notes.
* During the course of this project we will be required to deploy a webserver, test and monitor system components, test and monitor security measures.

Each participant in this project has the following common resources:
* a mac computer with at least 8GB of RAM that is intended to be used as a desktop workstation,
* an Intel based PC with at least 32GB of RAM and running Ubuntu Server version 24 accessible by the mac workstation by ssh.

We foresee that it might be helpful to distinguish within our project between Backend and Frontend products.

From the studies we have made in this area we anticipate the following needs in the backend side of the project:
* using Apache primarily for the web server but are open to experimenting with other options,
* using MySQL and postgresql for databases,
* support for php, javascript and python.

On the frontend we anticipate using tools such as Python and Javascript frameworks and libraries in conjunction with text editors such as Neovim.

We anticipate using containers to isolate backend components such Apache and MySQL in their own running environments, and a need for tools for managing the containers.

We anticipate using virtual machines to simulate web users that access our web server.
