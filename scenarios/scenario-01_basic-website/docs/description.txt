Simple Web Server
  Purpose:
   * Part of laboratory for studying Web DevOps
     -- understanding of technology associated with producing and serving web content on a computer network
     -- understanding the role of systems engineering in Web DevOps
     -- understanding tools for systems engineering in Web DevOps
   * Establish ground work for further study on more sophisticated scenarios

  Components:
   * Webserver, nginx or apache, running in docker container
   * One web page on the webserver consisting of a single Hello World page
   * Web browsers for accessing the web page
   * Wireshark network monitor

  Behavior of Interest:
   * Network protocols
   * Effect of configuration parameters
   * Effect of network options
   * Effect of hardware variations

   * Webserver, browsers, and wireshark monitor all run on a single host computer
   * All components are maintained under version control on GitHub
   * Actors and their roles under this scenario include:
     -- administrators: maintain and configure the system and its environment
     -- configuration manager: maintain the GitHub repository
     -- system engineers: design system, analyze system performance, and assess quality of service
     -- site designers: create and post the web page elements
     -- testers: verification and validation of system meeting requirements
     -- users: access website from browsers
     -- data scientists: observe system behavior, characterize observed data, assess conformity observations with expected behavior
